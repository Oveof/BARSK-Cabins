# "BARSK fjellferie"

## Summary
This was a school project made to show the culmination of everything we had learned in IT-2 in VG3. This website consists of three pages. One for ordering lift tickets, one for seeing the different cabins and information tied to those, and the last made to see which cabins are available in a given period and being able to "order" one/multiple.

### Lift Ticket / Heiskort
This application is made using object oriented programmering, combined with some functional. Every "person" order is an object created using the person class, with methods for adding and removing days.

### Cabin information / Hyttepresentasjon
